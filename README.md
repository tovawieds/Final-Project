State Population

This is a web page which displays the rank, FIPS code and population of each state, ranked in order.

There is a search box, enabling the user to enter a number to search for all population greater or equal to the specified number. The results will be displayed in rank order.
If the user enters a number that is too large, meaning that there are no states with that population, a message will show that n results match the search.
